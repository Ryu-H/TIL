# The Basics

## Action

- JSON Object
- Needs to have a `type` property that indicates the type of action being performed
- If the application grows in its complexity, it's better to define the types as string constants and also consolidate them into a separate module

## Action Creator

- Exactly as name suggests - functions that create Actions
```javascript
function addTodo(text) {
  return {
      type: ADD_TODO,
      text
    };
}
```
- Avoid conflating the terminology between Action and Action Creator
- Unlike Flux, Action Creators in Redux does not dispatch the Actions. Need to explicitly call the `dispatch()` function.
- You can create **Bound Action Creator** that will create and dispatch the Actions at once
```javascript
const boundAddTodo = text => dispatch(addTodo(text));
```
- `dispatch()` is often called by some sort of a helper rather than directly, like `connect()` from [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- You can use `bindActionCreator()` to bind many Action Creators to a `dispatch()` function
